# DL-Inference
This is a replication project. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04252.pdf).  
  
## Setup
Here, the images and model_data folders should be created. Inside of the images folder, there should be a val folder.
Inside of the model_data folder, the nested folder structure is like this: model_data/tensorflow/checkpoints/inception_v4, resnet_v1_152, mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.
Inside these folders, checkpoints should be placed respectively.  
## Running the project
First, the Database Tutorial.ipynb file should be run, and then the CSV_Tutorial.ipynb file.
