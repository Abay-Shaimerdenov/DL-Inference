# DL-Inference
Replication Project
Here, the images and model_data folders should be created. Inside of the images folder, there should be a val folder.
Inside of the model_data folder, the nested folder structure is like this model_data/tensorflow/checkpoints/inception_v4, resnet_v1_152, mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.
Inside these folders, checkpoints should be placed respectively.
