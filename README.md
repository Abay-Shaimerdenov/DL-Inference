# DL-Inference
This is a replication project. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04252.pdf). The original source code can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1242583#.WvAmFXUvz80).  
## Requirements to run this project
- *Jupyter Notebook*  
- *Python 2 - 3.7*  
- *Tensorflow 1.3 - 1.15*  
- *MySQL*  
- *sklearn, numpy*  
- *Pyro4*  
## Setup
*Adding image dataset ILSVRC 2012 (50K images) to the project*  

In the value folder (/images/val), **images** (/images/val/**images**/) folder should be created.  
Inside this folder, images sould be placed in such manner: _images/val/images/ILSVRC2012_val_00000001.JPEG_. Also, **xml** (/images/val/**xml**/) folder should be created. Inside the folder, the xml files (which contain bounding boxes) should be placed in such manner:  _images/val/xml/ILSVRC2012_val_00000001.xml_.
Image dataset (ImageNet LSVRC 2012) can be downloaded [here](https://academictorrents.com/details/5d6d0df7ed81efd49ca99ea4737e0ae5e3a5f2e5) (Click "I accept the terms" and download the torrent file). The xml files can be downloaded [here](https://academictorrents.com/details/dfa9ab2528ce76b907047aa8cf8fc792852facb9) (Click "I accept the terms" and download the torrent file).

*Adding checkpoints for the pre-trained DNNs*  

In the project folder (/), **model_data** (/**model_data**/) folder should be created.  
Inside **/model_data/tensorflow/checkpoints/** folder, three folders should be created: _/inception_v4/_, _/resnet_v1_152/_, _/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/_.   
Inside these folders, checkpoints should be placed respectively like this: _model_data/tensorflow/checkpoints/inception_v4/inception_v4.cpkt_ (mobilenet will have three files (3 x mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.cpkt.*)).    
Checkpoints can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim#pre-trained-models). 
## Running the project
First, the **Database Tutorial.ipynb** file should be run, and then the **CSV Tutorial.ipynb** file. After the two CSV files are generated (they are provided here), **Cross validating the premodel.ipynb** file should be run. A note: logistic regression in the *premodel.py* file was added by me (it was not in the original source code). Both premodels were trained with undersampled dataset. **Premodel_issues.ipynb** file shows some of the issues with premodel training. **Feature_checking.ipynb** shows the analysis of the features extracted.
